Inside DIV:

1st child = ?
2nd child = ?
3rd child = ?

Inside BODY:

1st child = ?
2nd child = ? 
BODY [ always Body is parent ]
├── DIV  [1 st child  for  body ]
│   ├── p (Pen) [ 1st child for div]
│   ├── p (Book) [ 2 nd child for div]
│   └── p (Eraser)[ 3 rd child for div]
└── p (is paragraph) [ 2nd child for body ]

Why this matters for nth-child

When CSS sees:
p:nth-child(3)
It asks
“Is this <p> the 3rd child of ITS PARENT?”
<p>Eraser</p> → YES (3rd child of div)
<p>is paragraph</p> → NO (it is 2nd child of body)
nth-child counts position inside the parent, not the tag type.
