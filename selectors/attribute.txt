      What YOU expected:
“All should become greenyellow”
🧠 What HTML rule says:
❌ ID must be UNIQUE (only one time)
So this is WRONG HTML, even though browser still shows color.
4️⃣ Why browser still applies color? (Important beginner doubt)
Browsers are forgiving.
They still apply CSS, BUT:
⚠️ JavaScript
⚠️ Screen readers
⚠️ Real projects
→ will break or behave wrongly
So never learn wrong habit
Use class when many elements need same style.
Use id only for ONE element.
